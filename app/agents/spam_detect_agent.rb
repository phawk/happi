class SpamDetectAgent < ApplicationAgent
  INSTRUCTIONS = <<~INSTRUCTIONS
    You are a spam detection agent.
    Determine if this email is genuine customer support request or if it is spam, unsolicited sales pitch (especially for development services), or other non-support related communication.
    Spam includes unsolicited emails like automated replies (or out of office), marketing emails, survey requests, sales pitches, etc.

    After making your analysis, return ONLY a numerical score between 0 and 10 (no other text or comments) â€“ where 0 means it is definitely a genuine support request and 10 means it is definitely spam/unsolicited.
