# Service objects

These are used to either: 
- Make controllers simple
- Perform complex operations
- Make the code more DRY (if a complex operation is needed in more than one place)
- Making calls to external APIs

Coding practices:
- https://dry-rb.org/gems/dry-monads/1.6/result/ - Dry::Monads[:result] is included in the ApplicationService (that all services should inherit from)
- Services should always return `Success(data)` or `Failure(MyError.new("whatever"))`.
