# Initial Happi Team Outreach Plan

## Direct Founder Outreach Strategy

### 1. Identify 50 Perfect-Fit Prospects
- Focus on solo SaaS founders and small teams (1-5 people) who match your ideal customer profile
- Target bootstrapped SaaS companies in the $5K-50K MRR range
- Look for companies with technical products where your code-aware knowledge base would be valuable
- Sources for leads:
  - IndieHackers profiles and discussions
  - ProductHunt launches from the past 6-12 months
  - Twitter/X communities of bootstrapped founders
  - MicroAcquire listings for active businesses

### 2. Research & Personalization
For each prospect:
- Test their current support system by sending a question to their support email
- Note response time, quality, and whether it seems AI-assisted
- Review their website for pain points your product solves (technical documentation needs, small team size)
- Find something specific to compliment about their product

### 3. Multi-Touch Outreach Sequence
**Initial Email:**
- Personalized opening referencing their specific product
- Brief explanation of why you built Happi Team for founders like them
- One specific feature that would solve a problem you noticed
- Clear, low-friction call to action (15-minute demo call)

**Follow-up 1 (if no response):**
- Share a quick tip related to customer support they could implement right away
- Gentle reminder of your offer

**Follow-up 2 (if no response):**
- Share a relevant case study or testimonial from Scott at Payhere
- Frame as "thought you might find this interesting" rather than pushy sales

### 4. Founder-to-Founder Connection
- Reach out founder-to-founder, not as a salesperson
- Emphasize that you built this to solve your own problems
- Offer to give honest feedback on their current support setup
- Position yourself as a peer who understands their challenges

### 5. Micro-Network Referrals
- Make a list of 10-15 founders you already know
- Ask for warm introductions to other founders who might benefit
- Offer something valuable in return (feedback on their product, promotion)
- Follow up on every introduction within 24 hours

## Community Participation Strategy

### 1. Select 3-5 Focused Communities
- IndieHackers (focus on product discussions)
- Bootstrapped Founders Slack group
- SaaS growth Discord communities
- Reddit r/SaaS or r/Entrepreneur

### 2. Provide High-Value Participation
- Answer support-related questions with detailed, actionable advice
- Share your own challenges and learnings from building Happi
- DO NOT lead with product pitches
- Build reputation as a support/customer success expert

### 3. Strategic Problem Solving
- When someone posts about customer support issues, provide a thoughtful solution
- Only mention your product as an aside if truly relevant
- Offer to continue the conversation in DMs

### 4. Exclusive Community Offers
- After building credibility, create special offers for community members
- Extended trial period (60 days vs standard 30)
- Free migration from existing systems
- Dedicated onboarding call with you personally

## Targeted Mini-Partnerships

### 1. Identify Complementary Tools
- Find 5-10 non-competing tools used by your target audience
- Focus on tools where customer support would be the next logical need
- Examples: billing solutions, analytics tools, development frameworks

### 2. Create Joint Value
- Propose simple cross-promotion with minimal effort required
- Offer to create integration tutorials or setup guides
- Share customer referrals that would benefit from their tool

### 3. Quick-Win Collaborations
- Co-host a small workshop (10-15 attendees) on scaling customer operations
- Create a joint resource pack (templates, guides, checklists)
- Exchange mentions in newsletters or product updates

## Early Adopter Program

### 1. Design a VIP Experience
- Create an exclusive "Founding Members" program limited to 10 spots
- Offer significant discount (40-50% off first year)
- Provide direct access to you for feedback and feature requests
- Include them in product roadmap discussions

### 2. Highlight the Benefits
- Influence product direction early
- Pride of being first and helping shape the tool
- Cost savings during early adoption
- Public recognition as founding customers (if desired)

### 3. Create Soft Deadline
- Set a clear timeframe for the program (next 30 days)
