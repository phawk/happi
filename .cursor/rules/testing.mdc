Testing
- Write comprehensive tests using RSpec.
- Prefer request specs rather than system tests. 
- Follow TDD/BDD practices.
- Use Rails fixtures or create Active Record objects for test data generation.
- VCR is available when testing requests that use the network. 
- Use `let` to define test data
- Keep tests short and concise
